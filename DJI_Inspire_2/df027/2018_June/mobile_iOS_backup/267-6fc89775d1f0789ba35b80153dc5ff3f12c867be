Keep the updated battery stationary for at least 72 hours and then check the abnormality again by installing the battery in the aircraft. Contact DJI Support if the issue cannot be solved by updating.\r\n•\tOptimized a rare issue where the remaining battery capacity is inaccurate, which can avoid the problem of inconsistent battery capacity when compared with the actual battery capacity.\r\n•\tOptimized the battery data communication logic to avoid rare battery communication abnormalities that appear during flight.\r\n•\tFixed an issue where one battery cannot supply power after powering on the aircraft.\r\n•\tFixed an issue where the battery cannot be turned on after being installed on the aircraft right after it has been removed from the charger.\r\n•\tOptimized the servo control logic to avoid a rare issue where the servo is damaged due to excessive resistance when the landing gear is used at low temperatures.\r\n•\tFixed an issue where the right dial would not set the camera exposure parameters (ISO/EI, shutter speed, and aperture) when using the Inspire 2 standard remote controller as the Slave controller and Cendence as the Master controller.\r\n•\tOptimized control over the Inspire 2 standard remote controller camera exposure parameters. Rotate the dial clockwise to increase the exposure and counter-clockwise to decrease it.\r\n•\tUpdated the Fly Safe system by including the current location of the mobile device into flight restriction strategies.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n•\tOnce the firmware has been updated, it cannot be reverted to former versions.\r\n•\tWhen using the Inspire 2 with the Zenmuse X4S/X5S/X7, it is recommended to update both at the same time.\r\n•\tEnsure both the Master and Slave remote controllers are updated to the latest firmware to avoid control errors or camera and gimbal abnormalities.\r\n•\tIf the firmware update fails, restart the aircraft, remote controller, and DJI GO 4, then retry. \r\n•\tIt is recommended to calibrate the sensors and vision systems to ensure that the aircraft is working optimally.\r\n"}}]
